# Review Sprints

Over the course of these sprints, you will be building a full stack application. Follow the requirements laid out in each sprint's README. You should be working in the `src` directory.

## The Project

The app you will be building is called GoalPosts. It allows users to save their individual goals, view them and mark them as complete. Once you are done with basic requirements, think of more features to implement such as:

- Sub-tasks
- Public versus Private goals
- Reminders (and automated emails!)
- User groups and shared goals

## What you should focus on

- Being able to read unfamiliar code.
- Speed. Look for patterns and test your hypotheses quickly.
- Debugging. Do not shy away from reading error messages and performing searches online.
  - The provided code is purposefully incomplete. Use error messages to guide you in your quest to build a working app.
- Developing a high level understanding of full-stack applications.
- Developing a plan with pseudocode (the READMEs will give you a high-level plan to work off of).

## Resources

Try not to reference any code in your past projects. Instead, use Google as your primary source of information.

- You should learn how to be autonomous in terms of "how to do" various tasks. However, if you don’t know “what to do", you should open a help ticket pretty quick.

- It’ll be the same on the job. Your co-workers won’t have time to go over every "how to do" question you might have, but they will always be willing to go over the “what to do” strategies and approaches.

## Tips

- Have a plan of action and pseudocode before writing any Javascript.
  - This usually begins with a clear idea of _what_ you want your app to do
- Pace yourself (don't rush past a requirement as soon as it works - make sure you understand why it works).
- Write clean code from the outset (not only does this make it easier for others to read your code but it will make finding bugs that much easier)
  - This is your opportunity to use higher order functions and declarative code. Avoid cumbersome if/else blocks and explicit loops if possible.
  - This is also a chance to flex your ES6 muscles. Node supports most [ES6 features](http://node.green).
